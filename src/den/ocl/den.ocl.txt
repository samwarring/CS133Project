I simply couldn't get this function to work. I tried for hours and could not get any 
correct results out of it. 

The main structure I believe is correct -- two seperate kernels, one to calculate
g and one to calculate u -- but nothing I do seems to have any effect on u.
I've tried a million different combinations of OpenCL code and literally nothing
causes the output image to have any change whatsoever.

I feel like I'm approaching the problem wrong, but that's on me I guess.
