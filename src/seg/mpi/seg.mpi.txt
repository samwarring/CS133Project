I concentrated my efforts on the dft and idft functions. Both functions are
parallelized in the same manner. I divided the work so that each process
writes to a contiguous set of columns in the final dst matrix. To make the
communication simpler, each process actually writes to the transpose-dst
matrix; the transpose is gathered then each process performs another
transpose individually.

I also made it so the first loop writes to the transpose-tmp matrix. This
makes the writing portion in the first loop slower, but it speeds up the
reading in the second loop due to spacial locality.
