I parallelized every outer for loop I could find, except for the iteration
for loop. Inside the iteration for loop, I parallelized the outer for loops
within. I had to use a reduction on addition on many of the inner for loops
to come out with a final value for the computation that happened.

The improvements were across the board better. Note that because of floating
point rounding issues, the reduction doesn't give the exact same value as
adding a large number of floating points sequentially would, and thus the
output image is not the same.

The bottleneck is the large number of barriers that OpenMP brings.
