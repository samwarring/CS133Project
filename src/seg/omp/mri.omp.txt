I parallelized the outer for loops of the dft and idft procedures. The gprof
tool listed these two as the most processor-intensive functions of the
program, so this improved performance significantly. In the main function,
I parallelized for loops whose bodies assigned values to f(i,j)/f0(i,j),
fftmul(i,j), and u_fft2(i,j). Each of these were also dynamically scheduled.
Attempts to parallelize any of the other loops resulted in output mismatches.

Some performance results are listed below. The results were obtained on
cs133.seas.ucla.edu. At the time, there were other users testing OpenMP
implementations.
