I parallelized the mri reconstruction program by parallelizing the dft and
idft functions with two kernels each. Each function consisted of two main
steps. The first writes to the tmp matrix, and the second writes to the dst
matrix. In my OpenCL implementation, each of these steps were implemented as
separate kernels. They required the creation of 6 buffer-objects: src, tmp,
dst, w1, w2, and one more to hold the matrix dimensions.

The speedups in the table below are very impressive, but as of this writing,
my OpenCL implementation produces fuzzier images than the sequential version.
